# Hyper™

**Hyper** is a terminal fully customizable, and this is the goal of the team who works on this project. With that, **Hyper** allows us to install themes and plugins, but if you want, you can create a your own plugin or theme!

## How to install

On this step I will show you how to install **Hyper™** terminal on **macOS** and **Linux**, but you can check on the link below other ways how to install and the details for other operating systems.

<ExternalLinkButton
  href={"https://hyper.is/#installation"}
  target={"_blank"}
  className={"mt-2 mb-4 inline-flex items-center gap-2"}
>
  <BiCloudDownload className={"h-6 w-6"} />
  <span>
    Installation - <strong>Hyper™</strong>
  </span>
</ExternalLinkButton>

<Tabs items={['macOS', <>Linux <small>(Debian distros.)</small></>]}>
    <Tab>
        Again **Homebrew** it's your best friend when you need to install anything, and **Hyper™** it's not an
        exception.

        ```bash copy
        brew install --cask hyper
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        On **Linux** you can easly download the `.deb` file and install, but if you prefer to do this using the terminal
        the steps are:
        1. **Download the `.deb` file:** `wget -O hyper-install.deb https://releases.hyper.is/download/deb`;
        2. **Install it:** `sudo gdebi hyper-install.deb`;
        3. Done, you can launch the **Hyper™** using the command `hyper`.

        <Callout emoji="⚠️️️">
            You need to have installed `wget` or change this command to use `curl`.
        </Callout>
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Configuration

The most important step!
Now, is the time about configurations and perosnalization of your **Hyper™**. I will split into two "steps", the first one remove unnecessary configurations and step two the configurations to add.

Before start, the **Hyper™** configuration file is located on `~/.hyper.js` and, usually, I open this file using my **VSCode** (`code ~/.hyper.js`).

### Clean your configuration file!

One this step you can remove the lines I will show you or only comment the line itself. In my case, I only remove settings related with colors to have sure the colors used is from my theme.

```js filename="~/.hyper.js" {1-2,27-28} copy
module.exports = {
  config: {
    // ...
    cursorColor: "rgba(248,28,229,0.8)",
    selectionColor: "rgba(248,28,229,0.3)",
    colors: {
      black: "#000000",
      red: "#C51E14",
      green: "#1DC121",
      yellow: "#C7C329",
      blue: "#0A2FC4",
      magenta: "#C839C5",
      cyan: "#20C5C6",
      white: "#C7C7C7",
      lightBlack: "#686868",
      lightRed: "#FD6F6B",
      lightGreen: "#67F86F",
      lightYellow: "#FFFA72",
      lightBlue: "#6A76FB",
      lightMagenta: "#FD7CFC",
      lightCyan: "#68FDFE",
      lightWhite: "#FFFFFF",
      limeGreen: "#32CD32",
      lightCoral: "#F08080",
    },
    // ...
  },
};
```

> **Note:** the lines highlighted isn't to remove, you need this lines for your configuration works!

### Let's customize!

First we will configure our plugins, by the way, when you restart your **Hyper™** terminal, the plugins and themes will be installed automatically.

```js {5-12} filename="~/.hyper.js" copy
module.exports = {
  config: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    "hyper-font-ligatures",
    "hyper-search",
    "hyper-pane",
    "hypercwd",
    "hyper-dracula",
    "hyper-tabs-enhanced",
  ],
};
```

> **Note:** only add the lines highlighted, when you install the **Hyper™** terminal the `plugins` will have an empty array.

**Short description about the plugins added:**

- `hyper-font-ligatures`: enable font ligatures (for icons and more);
- `hyper-dracula`: is the theme I'm using at the moment;
- `hyper-search`: for search text on our terminal;
- `hypecwd`: open new tabs or panels in the same directory;
- `hyper-tabs-enhanced`: enhance **Hyper™** tabs.

So, for `hyper-tabs-enhanced` I have a custom configuration, and if you want the same you only need to past the code below on the end of `config` object.

```js {4-9} filename="~/.hyper.js" copy
module.exports = {
  config: {
    // ...
    hyperTabs: {
      trafficButtons: true,
      tabIcons: true,
      tabIconsColored: true,
      border: false,
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

> **Note:** only add the lines highlighted.
