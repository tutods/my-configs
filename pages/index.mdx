# Introduction

Hello, my name is Daniel Sousa <small>@Tutods</small>, I'm a full-stack developer currently working with **Next.js** and **Nest.js**.

This are a simple pages but with one clear goal, help other developers customizing their terminals and share my configurations.

Before this, I have a repository with only a bunch of files and configuratiosn, but now, using **Nextra**, I create this step by step about how I customize my terminal to improve my productivity!

I hope this can be useful for you!
